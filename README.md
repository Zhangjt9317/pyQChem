## pyQChem - Input/Output-Tools for Q-Chem
 

PyQChem is a Python module designed for an intuitive manipulation of
[Q-Chem](http://www.q-chem.com) input and output files. It was written with special focus on the features of [IPython](http://ipython.org) such as tab completion and easy access to help docstrings via the question mark operator. 

To use pyQChem in your Python environment you have to put this folder
in the directory of your PYTHONPATH variable. On Unix/Mac, if this
variable is not set, add the following line to your .bash_profile:

> export PYTHONPATH= (path_to_your_folder)

Two IPython notebooks (and support files)  are provided as an introduction
to basic inputfile handling and outputfile parsing. Example Python scripts that use pyQChem can be found in the 'demos' directory.
